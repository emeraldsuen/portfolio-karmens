        <p class="body-text yellow-text">As a fun Halloween project for IAT 336 Materials in Design, a product design course at Simon Fraser University, we were instructed to pick a character of our choosing and replicate three props or wearables
          for
          that character.

        <p class="body-text">Working with another SIAT student, Kaylie Au, we focused on D.Va, a fictional character from the video game, Overwatch. We chose to create her blaster, headset, and a trophy that can act as a holder for both props.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">I was in charge of creating the blaster and Kaylie worked on the headset. We both came together to create the trophy.

          as a guide, I created the first prototype using insulation foam, also known as pink foam. However
          this material was
          quite thick and did not provide a good grip for the user.

        <p class="med-type">Adding Circuits</p>
        <p class=" body-text">As a group, we decided to add LEDs to both the gun and the headset. With the help of the professor, I soldered together five LEDs with a button (placed behind the trigger), and a 6V battery power source. I ensured that
          the battery could be replaced by creating a compartment within the handle of the blaster, adding a tab to the battery holder for easy removal. I also created a foam core skeleton that holds the circuit in place.

        <p class="body-text">Layers and pieces of pink foam were trimmed and carved to fit around the skeleton. Both foam core and pink foam were sanded to provide the shape of the prop, as well as a comfortable grip around the handle.

        <p class="body-text">The surface of the blaster was primed with white glue before painting with acrylics. As the paint created a rough surface, it was covered with white glue again to ensure
          the paint will not peel off. Spackling was used to fill the seams between foam and was painted again to cover the white surface.

    <!-- USER CONSIDERATIONS -->

      <div class="work-left">
        <p class="med-type">User Considerations</p>
        <p class=" body-text">This project challenged me to think about how the
          user can grip the gun comfortably and easily press on the trigger. I used EVA foam on the handle, which was much softer than pink foam. The edges of the handle were also sanded down to avoid sharp edges. Some other things I had to consider
          was the removal of the battery compartment. Initally, I only cut out a flap from the foam core. However, I had to add a small strip to the
          battery holder, so it was more easily removable for the user.

        <p class=" body-text">This project took me out of my comfort zone as I was required to design with different materials and use hands on
          tools that would not otherwise be used in SIAT. While the creation of this prop is not technology based, this fun project provided me with the experience of a user-centered approach to fabrication.
