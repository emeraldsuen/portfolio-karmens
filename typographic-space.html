      <div class="work-left">
        <p class="body-text yellow-text">Typographic Space is an academic project that focuses on the geometric typeface, Avenir. A mock magazine was created that features four different graphical layouts that:
        </p>
        <ol class="ordered-list yellow-text">
          <li>Rely solely on type</li>
          <li>Includes typographic elements</li>
          <li>Introduces a secondary typeface</li>
          <li>Features extreme size and weight contrast</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="body-text yellow-text">Dieter Rams&#39; <em>10 Principles for Good Design</em> is the content of these layouts and are reflected in my design. </p>

        <p class="body-text">As this project is typography based, working directly on Adobe Illustrator allowed me to quickly adjust placement, sizing, and orientation. The above images are only a small portion of the exploration I have done
          through
          my ideation phase.

    <!-- MOCKUPS -->
    <div class="project-container">
      <div class="work-left">
        <p class="med-type">Mockups</p>
        <p class="body-text">I narrowed down my sketches to four layouts that had potential for further development, fine tuning them for the final compositions. In the first three layouts, I
          focused on clarity. The last layout took a more conceptual
          and expressive spin.

      </div>

    <!-- FINAL LAYOUTS -->
    <p class="med-type">Final Layouts</p>
    <button class="accordion">Layout 1
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <div class="img-center img-shadow">
        <img src="img/layout1.png" class="panel-img" alt="layout1">
      </div>
      <p class="body-text">In layout one, I was limited to one font size and two weights. Many of my initial mockups were either symmetrical, or badly balanced. Ultimately, I chose to use a bold typeface for headings and indented the body text
        to
        establish hierarchy in the composition. The lower right placement gives the piece a sense of balance and stability.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Layout 2
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <div class="img-center img-shadow">
        <img src="img/layout2.png" class="panel-img" alt="layout2">
      </div>
      <p class="body-text">The second composition required me to include typographic elements that included lines, shapes, or textures. I chose to use a vertical line that runs through the page, with small circles that indicate the start of
        each
        principle.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Layout 3
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <div class="img-center img-shadow">
        <img src="img/layout3.png" class="panel-img" alt="layout3">
      </div>
      <p class="body-text">Inspired by Massimo Vignelliâ€™s work, I chose to introduce a large and bold Helvetica paired with a small body text. The line-text-line pattern created a natural, free flowing pattern throughout the layout. I paid
        close
        attention to the relationship between heading and body, matching the baselines and x-heights of both chunks of text.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Layout 4
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <div class="img-center img-shadow">
        <img src="img/layout4.png" class="panel-img" alt="layout4">
      </div>
      <p class="body-text">The last piece is my most expressive one in the assignment. Graphic design often appears to have a checklist of elements for successful compositions. I used these elements that are typically categorized as efficient
        design
        tools, including a grid structure, asymmetrical balance, and contrast, and created one chaotic and unreadable composition by overworking these tools. The idea originated when fiddling with mockups for layout one and three. The two
        initial
        iterations had two different grid structures, with the large headings spanning 68 pixels per column and the small body text sharing a five column grid.
      </p>

    <div class="reflection-container">
      <p class="med-type">Reflection</p>
      <p class="body-text">Because of their vastly opposing concepts, I believe that the third and fourth layouts are the highlights of Typographic Space. On the one hand, I demonstrated the use of the 10 principles listed in my magazine in layout
        three, focusing on unobtrusiveness and challenging my attention to small typographic details. On the other hand, the last layout is the antithesis of Dieter Rams&#39; principles.</p>
      <p class="body-text">My final presentation of the four distinct compositions were compiled into a magazine format that includes an introduction, a process documentation, and a design rationale. The magazine is printed on 100lb paper and
        bound
        using saddle
        stitch.</p>
      <p class="body-text">This academic project challenged my attention to detail, such as kerning, leading, and text alignment, carefully on each page of the publication. If I had another chance to redo this project, I would use another typeface
        for my magazine
        content, which may be riskier, but it can set apart my four compositions from the entire work.
